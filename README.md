The following code helps in calculating the volume and the Total Surface Area (TSA) of the mesh selected
if you select the mesh 'cylinder' from
1.cube
2.cuboid
3.cylinder
you have to enter the serial number of the mesh which is 3 here

Please help me find any shortcuts to any functions or steps
Thank You
